            About Me
        </h1>
        <p>
            Hey there! I'm a mechanical engineering grad who kicked off my career designing fiber optic cables. After that, I decided to give retail banking a shot, but turns out, it wasn't my cup of tea. </p>

        <p> 
            During my exploring and searching phase, I stumbled upon coding and, guess what, it totally clicked for me! The whole coding world seemed so interesting and I felt this is where i belog.
        </p>
            Now, I'm all in on pursuing a career in coding. I love the challenge, problem-solving, and the endless possibilities it offers. My journey so far, from engineering to banking and now coding, has shaped my analytical thinking and I'm ready to bring that to the tech scene.
        <p>
            I'm not just looking for a job; I'm on the lookout for a place where I can grow, learn, and be a part of something awesome. Join me as I navigate this coding adventure. Let's make some cool stuff together!
